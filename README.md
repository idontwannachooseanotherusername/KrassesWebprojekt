# Webproject - MindBreaker

## Mindbreaker
MindBreaker is a website for solving and creating challenges/riddles and gaining points in doing so. It features:
 - A simple reqister/login system
 - Profile editing with custom images and banner
 - Challenge Creator/Editor
 - Challenges have tags, difficultylevels and categories by which they can be sorted
 - A simple pointsystem that rewards users for solving and creating challenges

## Be careful
This is just a simple test project and should not be used for anything other than fun and testing. Passwords are hashed saltless with MD5, the RSA key for the webtoken is publicly available, the node version is way too old and there most definitely are some bugs.
