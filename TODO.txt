KEEP IN MIND
- Login form is used for loging in AND signing upload
- When creating a challenge a lot of entries have to be made in other tables
 -> ChallengeTag
 -> ChallengeFile
 -> ...
- These entries also need to get deleted if challenge gets deleted!
- Uploaded files should be renamed to their hash value to avoid name conflicts
  and to make sure we aren't saving the same image over and over again
