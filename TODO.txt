TODO

- Implement json Webtoken
 -> (Do not set cookie via js)
 -> (Login form without ajax call)
 -> More checking needed? (FINAL)

- Finish implementing challengecreator
 -> Add file upload functionality
 -> Possibility to delete uploaded files
 -> load current files into fields
 -> Uploaded files should be renamed to their hash value to avoid name conflicts
  and to make sure we aren't saving the same image over and over again

- (When getting challenge via ajax: Pass category as object and not only as Name)

FINAL
- Remove unused functions from api
- Remove unused functions from frontend JavaScripts
- Test everything
 -> Creating new user
 -> Visit all sites
 -> Logout
 -> Login
 -> Try breaking permission system
   - Profileditor
   - Challenge
   - Challengecreator
   - Getting Hints
   - ...
 -> Edit profile (with banner and pb)
 -> Change password
 -> Create challenge
 -> Edit challenge
 -> Delete challenge
 -> Delete User
 -> Look for visual bugs
- Test in Firefox and Chrome (Brave)
- Have at least 3 "real" users
- Create at least one real challenge per difficulty Level
- Maybe decide whether to use jQuery or plain js
